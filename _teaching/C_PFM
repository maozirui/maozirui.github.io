The Phase-Field platform solves the general Allan-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations using Finite Difference Method (with uniform grid) or Gradient Smoothing Method (with adaptive grid). Two numerical solvers are provided: a simple explicit solver and an efficient implicit solver. The in-house code will be released as planned associated with upcoming paper publication.
