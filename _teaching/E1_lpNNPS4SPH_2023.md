Herein, we introduce a GPU-accelerated mixed-precision SPH framework by using low precision FP16 in NNPS while maintaining high-precision FP64 in other components.

The [FP-16 based NNPS4SPH source code](https://github.com/pnnl/lpNNPS4SPH) is released and explained under a [DOE project](https://www.osti.gov/doecode/biblio/115773).
