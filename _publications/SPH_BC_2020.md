# Abstract
Absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) play a critical role in the simulation of sound or wave propagation problems. This paper proposes a technique of space–time transformed perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary condition implemented in a widely used mesh-free method called smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method, to absorb the outgoing sound waves with oblique shear mean flow. Special consideration is given to the particle features of the SPH, and the PMLs are formulated to correct the truncation error of SPH and absorb the outgoing wave at the same time, aiming to reduce the storage and computational cost in the infinite computational domain. Because the group velocity and phase velocity of the outgoing sound waves in the PMLs may be in different directions, exponentially growing pseudo reflections can result. The authors thus employ space–time transformation to eliminate the reflections effectively in PML boundaries for stable solutions. Moreover, a uniform framework of PML absorbing boundary conditions for Euler equations in the cases of arbitrary oblique mean flow and static media is derived. Finally, the present PML-SPH method with this stable absorbing boundary is applied to simulate sound waves propagating with mean flow. The obtained numerical results agree very well with the reference results.
