# Abstract
Thanks to its meshfree feature, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has apparent advantages over the traditional finite element method for addressing large deformation problems in geotechnical engineering, e.g., landslides. This chapter provides the essentials of SPH theory and the key ingredients of SPH modeling. Especially, the stability-related issues are investigated and discussed by carrying out some benchmarking examples. Then, the effectiveness of SPH modeling is validated by applying it to a series of granular column collapse and earthquake-induced landslides. Finally, the most recent development of SPH is reviewed, and the Pros/Cons of SPH modeling relative to the conventional grid-based methods and other meshfree methods are explored in detail. Some latest advice on the use of SPH in geotechnical engineering is also involved in this chapter.
